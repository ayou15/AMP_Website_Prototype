		<h2> What is Forex </h2>	
		<p>
		The Foreign Exchange market, the largest capital market in the world, is a collaboration of currency trading originating from all parts of the world. The participants involved in Forex trading include the world's largest banks, major investors and corporations, as well as retail tradersâ€”such as yourself. The Forex market is no typical market such as the stock market, the volume that is traded outweighs these stock markets, like the New York Stock Exchange, by almost xxx%, and it is open 24 hours a day 5 days a week. As a comparison, the daily volume of the entire stock market is estimated at around $60 Billion, in comparison, the volume of Forex exceeds $3 Trillion every day! This categorises the Forex market as  - by far - the largest and the most liquid market in the word. <br><br>
Participation by individual traders has grown phenomenally in recent years with the proliferation of the Internet, enhancements in personal computers and Forex trading software, the launch of dozens of cash Forex firms taking advantage of online trading, and the globalization of markets in general. The introduction of the Euro currency on January 1, 1999, and the weakness of the U.S. dollar after peaking in 2001 also contributed to the surge of interest and popularity in Forex trading. <br><br>
Every country has its own currency to facilitate its business and trade. The value of one currency against another depends on the economic health of the nations involved as well as the perception of stability and confidence in the political climate in each country. As conditions change, currency values fluctuate to reflect the new economic situation. And while these fluctuations might create challenges for economists, policy makers, and government officials, they provide tremendous opportunities for traders who want to speculate on impending changes in currency values.<br><br>
So as the Forex currencies move up, we make money when we buy - and as they move down, we make money when we sell. Seems simple enough, but the real key to Forex success is knowing when to get IN to a trade and when to get OUT!
